[[ComponentsSection]]
= Components

The body of a <<NewsArticle,NewsArticles>> is broken up into individual, modular
components.

All components are represented as JSON objects with a special "@type" key that
identifies the type of component. For example, an image component might be
represented as the the following JSON object:

[source,json]
--
{
  "@type": "image",
  "url": "https://example.com/images/example.jpeg",
  "width": 300,
  "height": 150
}
--

The following sections document these components and their parameters.
