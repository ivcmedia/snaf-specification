# string

[.lead]
A JSON string containing valid UTF-8 text.

## Validations

- Must be UTF-8 encoded.
- Unless otherwise stated, all strings are limited to 4086 bytes.footnote:[
  This is to protect against potential denial of service attacks. The value of
  4086 bytes is somewhat arbitrary, but a typical english paragraph is between
  2-5 lines of 50-60 characters each or around 300 bytes in UTF-8. A limit of
  4086 bytes is plenty of room for english sentences and should be enough for
  fairly lengthy Chinese and other languages that assign multiple bytes per
  character]
