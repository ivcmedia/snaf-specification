# EmailAddress

[.lead]
A <<string>> containing a parsable email address.

## Validations

- Must be fewer than 254 characters long.footnote:[This is to protect against
  potential denial of service attacks. The length of 254 characters is based
  upon the maximum length supported by the SMTP protocol (see this
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/386294/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-valid-email-address[StackOverflow]
  response).]
- Must match the PCRE regex `^.+@.+$`.footnote:[This regex is only meant to
  protect against the most egregious errors in email address entry.]
